"""The runtime-control seam: what switched-off routing binds, and what a caller reports.

**Disabled adapter.** When a deployment switches review routing off
(``RECONBREAKS_REVIEW_ROUTING=off``), the container binds :class:`DisabledReviewRouter` instead
of the profile's class. It satisfies the port and submits nothing, and the container logs the
posture at startup.

**Recording wrapper.** Every caller that runs a reconciliation (the API route, the agent tool,
the CLI) wraps the bound router in :class:`RecordingReviewRouter` for that one run and passes it
INTO :class:`~recon_breaks_engine.domain.resolution_service.ResolutionService` in place of the
bound router, so the domain routes every drafted resolution exactly as before and the wrapper
sits outside it. What the caller returns can then say what happened: ``routed``, ``failed``,
``off`` or ``not_required``. A failure is logged and absorbed here rather than failing an
already-reconciled, already-audited run, but it is never invisible: the caller reports
``failed``, which nobody can mistake for a reviewed result.
